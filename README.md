#README FOR LINUX USERS

This is one of my first projects, so the code may not be well readable. But it works!

Run Terminal on your device.

Type path to the directory with .c and .h files.
```
	cd home/yourusername/path/to/nand2tetris-assembler-master
```

Run
```
	make
```

Put .asm files to the directory with the source code.

Then execute
```
	./assembler file_to_read.asm file_to_convert.hack
```
	
The names of files .asm and hack. should be the same.
