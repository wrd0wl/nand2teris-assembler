# nand2teris-assembler
README FOR LINUX USERS

This is one of my first projects, so the code may not be well readable. But it works!

Run Terminal on your device.

Type 
	cd home/yourusername/path/to/nand2tetris-assembler-master - path to the directory with .c and .h files.

Run
	make

Then execute
	./assembler file_to_read.asm file_to_convert.hack
	
The names of files .asm and hack. should be the same.
